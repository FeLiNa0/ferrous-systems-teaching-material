= Exercise: TCP client
:source-language: rust

In this exercise, we will implement a simple TCP client.

You will learn:

* How to write a simple single-threaded client tool
* Read and write Strings to the
* How to close parts of a bidirectional stream

== Task

1. Start a TCP connection on port `127.0.0.1:8080`
2. Send a message over
3. Close the write end of the connection
4. Print the response to the console

== Getting started

Use this template:

[source,rust]
----
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let arg = std::env::args().nth(1);

    let message = match arg {
        Some(msg) => msg,
        None => String::from("Default Message"),
    };


    //...
    Ok(())
}
----

Read the documentation for the `TcpStream`, especially the `shutdown` methods.
