The async mailbox
-----------

In this exercise, you will learn how to turn a small server implemented using threads
into an asynchronous server.

Copy `/solutions/threaded-mailbox` to your work directory.

1. Add async-std as a dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open `Cargo.toml` and add:

----
[dependencies]
async-std = "1.6"
----

2. Replace sync types by async types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replace all synchronous/blocking types (e.g. `Thread`, `Mutex`, `TcpListener`) by async types.

Turn functions into async functions if necessary.

3. Observe the result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed? What stayed the same. Describe your experience.

4. Additional Exercice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make the program listen on IPV4 and IPV6.
