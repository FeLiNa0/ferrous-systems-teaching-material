# FFI exercise: Binding to LevelDB

In this exercise your task is to create a Rust binding, or foreign function interface (FFI) to the [LevelDB] database library. Typically, and also in this exercise, "foreign" means "C".

You will learn how to:

- handle pointers passed to or from the foreign language
- use low-level C bindings
- utilize Rust's ownership system to provide safety on top of¬†those raw primitives

# Prerequisites

This exercise requires knowledge of a few Rust and C concepts:

- [Ownership & Borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html)
- [Lifetime annotations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html)
- [Traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html)
- [Iterators](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html)
- [Casting](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/types/cast.html)
- [Error handling with `Result` and `Option`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error.html)
- [Unsafe Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html)
- C strings represented as null-terminated chunks of 8-bit `char`s
- using C pointers as function parameters for returning multiple results in one call

Conceptually, LevelDB is a [key-value store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database), AKA a persistent dictionary or map.

## Mental exercise: Ownership in C

  <summary>Solution</summary>
  Ownership is handled only informally - typically an API's documentation and/or function names (e.g. "create", "new") will indicate whether you are responsible to free up the memory passed to you, or it is somebody else's problem. Unclear ownership (via multiple pointers to the same memory) or API misunderstandings can easily lead to memory being freed too often or too little, resulting in crashes or leaks.

# Setup
## The sys crate
Binding to C is divided into two parts: a minimal low-level interface, a so-called "sys crate" and a higher level crate. The sys crate handles linking to the C library and exposes its parts directly. The higher level crate uses the sys crate to provide a more Rust-friendly interface by safely wrapping the inherently `unsafe` raw parts. Writing a sys crate yourself is beyond our scope here - it's [provided for you](https://docs.rs/leveldb-sys/2.0.8/leveldb_sys/) and therefore goes into the `Cargo.toml`'s `[dependencies]` section. You'll also need the `libc` crate which provides C types and other required definitions:
```
[dependencies]
leveldb-sys = "2"
libc = "0.2"
```

Building `leveldb-sys` requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and a C++ compiler (gcc, clang, Visual Studio etc.) to be installed on your system.

> üîé Should you ever need to write your own sys crate you can find intructions for doing so [here](https://kornel.ski/rust-sys-crate).

## Testing
LevelDB, being a database, persists data to disk. When writing tests for your binding, creating this data in a temporary fashion is appropriate, saving you from doing cleanup work yourself. The [tempdir](https://docs.rs/tempdir/0.3.7/tempdir/) crate provides this functionality, but if you added it to `[dependencies]` it would also be installed for every user of your library, even if they didn't intend to run your tests. Fortunately, Cargo has a `[dev-dependencies]` section for crates that are only required during development:
```
[dev-dependencies]
tempdir = "0.3"
```



# Exercise: Opening and closing a database

## Preparation
Conceptually, a LevelDB database is a directory (the "database name") where all its required files are stored. "Opening" it means passing a path (whose last part is the database name) and some options to `leveldb_open`, notably `create_if_missing`, which will create the database directory in case it does not exist.

You'll also need these functions and enums from the `leveldb-sys` crate:

* `leveldb_t`: opaque handle representing an opened database. The handle is thread-safe.
* `leveldb_open`: opens a database, returning `leveldb_t`
* `leveldb_close`: closes a `leveldb_t` for a clean shutdown
* `leveldb_options_t`: opaque handle representing database options
* `leveldb_options_create`: create an instance of this options struct
* `leveldb_options_destroy`: deallocates `leveldb_options_t`
* `leveldb_options_set_create_if_missing`: sets the `create_if_missing` flag on `leveldb_options_t`.

The [LevelDB C header](https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/master/include/leveldb/c.h) documents some conventions used by its implementation. 


## Your tasks
‚úÖ Implement functions for:
- opening a database, optionally creating it
- closing it again

‚úÖ Create Handle structs for the raw `leveldb_t` and `leveldb_options_t` types, taking care of the required cleanup operations

‚úÖ Create a `Database` struct that manages high-level operations, wrapping the handle

## Polishing your solution

How's your error handling? `open` should not panic - return a custom error instead. To keep things concise, make use of the [question mark operator] (see also [the following section] on using it in tests). Convert errors where necessary.

[question mark operator]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html
[the following section]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/question-mark-in-main-and-tests.html

‚úÖ Test the success and error cases.

---

The most straightforward parameter type for the database name is `&str` ([why not `String`?](https://www.ameyalokare.com/rust/2017/10/12/rust-str-vs-String.html)). Since we're dealing with paths, what would be an alternative that still has the convenience of using string literals on the caller side?

‚úÖ Change your function signature accordingly.

## Help and hints
- You need to pass an error pointer to `open`. The C library potentially mutates it, and initially it should point to `null`. For creating a suitable pointer Rust provides you with [`std::ptr::null_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/fn.null_mut.html).
- A null pointer is equal (`==`) to any other null pointer.
- If an error occurs you *own* the C string containing the error message. You can either free it or reuse it for future calls - which option is more convenient?
- When `open` succeeds, it gives you a *valid, non-null* pointer back. A natural mapping for this type is [`NonNull::new_unchecked`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/struct.NonNull.html#method.new_unchecked).
- Owned C strings can be created with [`std::ffi::CString`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ffi/struct.CString.html). Note that unlike C strings, Rust strings can contain null bytes.
- To handle paths there's [`std::path::Path`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.Path.html). For simplicity reasons, assume paths are valid UTF-8, which in the real world isn't always the case. 
- Errors can be converted with [`map_err` and `From::from`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/multiple_error_types/reenter_question_mark.html).
- String types implement <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.AsRef.html">AsRef&lt;Path&gt;</a>, which makes it a good fit for path parameters.



# Exercise: Reading and writing database contents

Now that you have an open database, it's time to interact with it by storing and retrieving data. 

## Preparation

You'll need a few more items from the sys crate:
* `leveldb_readoptions_t`: opaque type to specify read operation options
* `leveldb_writeoptions_t`: opaque type to specify write operation options
* `leveldb_readoptions_create`: creates a default `readoptions_t`
* `leveldb_readoptions_destroy`: deallocates `readoptions_t`
* `leveldb_writeoptions_create`: creates a default `writeoptions_t`
* `leveldb_writeoptions_destroy`: deallocates `writeoptions_t`
* `leveldb_put`: writes a binary value for a given binary key
* `leveldb_get`: reads a binary value for a given binary key. Returns a `null` pointer for "not found", an *owned* object otherwise.
* `leveldb_free`: deallocates a value object returned by `leveldb_get`

## Your tasks

‚úÖ Implement two functions on your `Database` type: 
- `pub fn put(&self, key: &[u8], data: &[u8]) \-> Result<(), Error>`
- `pub fn get(&self, key: &[u8]) \-> Result<Option<Box<[u8]>>, Error>`

Be mindful of the API's ownership contract.

‚úÖ Test your implementation.


## Help and hints
- You only need to create (and destroy!) the read/write options objects, not configure them further in any way.
- Stuck with the wrong primitive type? Try casting it.
- `b"a string"` is literal syntax for creating an `&[u8]` slice.
- Here's how to put a slice on the heap (AKA box it):
  ``` 
  let slice = std::slice::from_raw_parts(data as *mut u8, len);
  let result = Box::from(slice);
  ```
  ‚ùó note that you've now created a copy of the data and still own (and therefore have to free) the raw pointer.
- don't free `null` pointers.

# Exercise: Iterate over database contents

In this last part we'll create an `Iterator` for looping over everything stored in our database.

## Preparation

The iterator functionality is exposed by the sys crate as follows:

* `leveldb_create_iterator`: Creates an opaque `leveldb_iterator_t` handle
* `leveldb_iter_seek_to_first`: Starts the iteration by seeking to the first item
* `leveldb_iter_next`: Advances iteration by one element
* `leveldb_iter_value`: Reads the value at the current iterator position
* `leveldb_iter_valid`: Indicates whether the iterator is currently valid


An iterator is position invalid before seeking to the first item and after it has advanced beyond the last one. Reading its value returns *non-owned* data.

## Your tasks

‚úÖ Implement an iterator handle. It should fully encapsulate any `unsafe` code.

‚úÖ Implement an `Iterator` type that holds the necessary state and makes use of the handle.

‚úÖ Implement `pub fn iter(&self) \-> Iterator` for your `Database` struct.

‚úÖ Implement [`std::iter::Iterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) for your `Iterator` type. Its items should be of type `Box<[u8]>`.

‚úÖ Make the `Iterator` type reference the Database that created it. What has changed and what are the benefits?

‚úÖ Test appropriately.

‚úÖ Bonus task: what could be used instead of the `Database` reference that achieves the same goal but consumes no memory?
