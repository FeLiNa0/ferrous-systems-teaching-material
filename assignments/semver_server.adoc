= Exercise: TCP Echo Server
:source-language: rust

In this exercise, we will implement a crate repository server.

You will learn:

* How to use modules and visibility
* How to write a simple single-threaded server binary
* Read Strings from the network
* How to handle a connection lifecycle

== Task

1. Move all your previous work on `SemVer` into a `lib.rs` module
2. Create a skeleton TCP server based on https://github.com/ferrous-systems/teaching-material/tree/master/assignments/solutions/tcp-echo-server
3. Deserialize incoming crates based on the following protocol:
    - `GET <crate_name>`
    - `PUT <crate_data>`
4. on PUT, store the crate data in your repository.
5. on GET, return a crate from your repository, or a custom error if it cannot be found.

== Note

To send and receive messages, you can either use `nc` or `telnet`. Alternatively, you can use the client provided: https://github.com/ferrous-systems/teaching-material/tree/master/assignments/solutions/tcp-client
