The multithreaded mailbox
-------------------------

Bring your TCP server and the protocol we wrote yesterday together.

1. Implement multithreading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Per connection:

1.  spawn a thread using `std::thread::spawn`
2.  wrap the `VecDeque` in a `std::sync::Mutex` and an `std::sync::Arc`
to pass it around


== Note

To send and receive messages, you can either use `nc` or `telnet`. Alternatively, you can use the client provided: https://github.com/ferrous-systems/rust-three-days-course/tree/master/example/redisish-client

Usage:

----
cargo run --bin publish -- "This is my message"
cargo run --bin retrieve
----
