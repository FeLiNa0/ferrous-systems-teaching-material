A simple chat
-------------

Implement a simple chat using `async-std`.

In this exercise, you will learn:
* How to use async tasks for synchronisation
* How to do simple connection handing
* How to use async channels

Note: this is a trimmed down version ot the tutorial found in the https://book.async.rs/tutorial/index.html[async-std book].

1. Clone the template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[source,rust]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:skade/async-chat-template.git
----

2. The protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The protocol is simple:

* The first line a client sends is its name
* Every subsequent line is a message

3. Task
~~~~~~~

Implement the client function so that it:

* It reads the name of the client
* Then registers the client with the broker
* Spawns 2 tasks, one to read the incoming messages, one to deliver outgoing

== Clone everywhere

This is an unoptimised example and moves `String` around everywhere. `clone` liberally, optimisations can come later.

== Iterating over incoming lines

[source,rust]
----
let mut buf_read = BufReader::new(stream.clone());

let mut lines = buf_read.lines();

while let Some(Ok(line)) = lines.next().await {
    //...
}
