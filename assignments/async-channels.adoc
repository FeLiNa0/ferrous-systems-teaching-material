= Exercise: async channels
:source-language: rust

Let's refactor our async application a little bit. Instead
of using a Mutex to moderate our queue, let's instead use
a single task and use a channel for synchronisation.

== Task

1. Pick a MPMC channel module (recommended tokio, async-std or async-channel)
2. Implement a function `mailbox` that turns loops over all incoming messages and
** On "PUBLISH", just stores data
** On "RETRIEVE", sends the message back to the task requesting the data
3. Make sure this function gets started correctly

NOTE: you will need to implement 2 channels, one towards your mailbox and one backchannel.

== Getting started

Use this template:

[source,rust]
----
async fn mailbox_function(storage: VecDeque<String>, recv: Receiver</* */>) {
  // ...
}
----
