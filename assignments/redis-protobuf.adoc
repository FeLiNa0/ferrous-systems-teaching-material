= Exercise: redis client
:icons: font
:source-highlighter: rouge

In this exercise, we will extend our redis client with protocol buffers functionality.

== Preparation + Setup

Step 1::
Create a binary project called `redis-client-protobuf`: `cargo new --bin redis-client-protobuf`

Step 2::
+
--
Implement a command line handler that lets your program either
* get and print the value for a given key, or
* set a given value for a given key, and
* defaults to `127.0.0.1` as the server to connect to, but lets you override that

Step 4::
+
--
Add a library crate to your package and implement a `RedisClient` struct that can get and set values. Test its functionality with a round trip (set `key` to `value`, assert `get(key) == value`)
