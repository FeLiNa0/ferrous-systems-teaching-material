== ints

Rust comes with all standard int types, with and without sign

- i8, u8
- i16, u16
- i32, u32
- i64, u64
- i128, u128

== Architecture-dependent numbers

Rust comes with 2 architecture-dependent number types:

- isize, usize

== Casts

Casts between number are possible, *also shortening casts*:

[source,rust]

include::./1.rs[]
----

== !

If the size isn't given, or cannot be inferred, ints default to `i32`.

== Overflows

Overflows trigger a trap in Debug mode, but not in release mode. This behaviour can be configured.

== Floats

Rust also comes with floats of all standard sizes: f32, f64

== Arrays

Fixed-size arrays have the following notation:

[source,rust]

include::./3.rs[]

== Arrays of dynamic size

Arrays of dynamic size in Rust are represented as slices.

Slices carry a pointer to the array and a length. Slices cannot be resized.
