Hurry up and wait

`async` & `await`

---

Future = asynchronous computation

* Network IO
* Message from another thread or computer
* Chained operations

---

Rust has no implicit runtime event loop (like i.e. node.js)

== Layers of abstractions

---

`Future<T>` and `Poll<T>`

Part of `libcore` and `libstd`

---

`futures-rs` abstraction crate on top of those

---

`tokio` abstraction crate provides event-loop

== It's all...not stable

Requires nightly and `futures_api` feature-flag

---

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]
----

---

[source,rust]
----
include::./2.rs[]
----

---

Most futures won't be ready immediately.

Instead return `Poll::Pending` until ready.

`poll()` future from event-loop.

`futures-rs` to the rescue

---

There's `oneshot`

[source,rust]
----
include::./3.rs[]
----

---

And combinators on futures

[source,rust]
----
include::./4.rs[]
----

== Explicit runtime

![](img/tokio.jpg)

`tokio-rs` to the rescue

---

`tokio` provides an async-executor and runtime

[source,rust]
----
include::./5.rs[]
----


== Future of `futures`

<br/>

* Two new keywords
* Write code that looks synchronous
  * Get async for free*

== I want that!

== Timeline

* RFC 2394 (tracking issue #50547)
* Implemented in the compiler
* Several blocking issues (#51719, #53249, #53259, ...)
* _Not_ included in Rust 2018
  * But soonâ„¢ (~~late 2018~~ 2019!)
