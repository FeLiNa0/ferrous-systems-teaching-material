= Simple Generics

== !

Generics are fundamental for Rust.

== Generic Structs

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]

== Type Inference

Rust finds the types of all variables and generics with sufficient information.

This only applies *inside* of function limits.

Signatures must always be fully entered.

== Generic Enums

[source,rust]
----
include::./2.rs[]

== Important Generic Enums

== Option

[source,rust]
----
include::./3.rs[]
----

Describes a value which does not have to be present.

`None` is a value, and should not be confused with `null`.

== Result

[source,rust]
----
include::./4.rs[]
----

Describes whether an operation was successful and returns either the value or an error.

== Typical Results

[source,rust]
----
include::./5.rs[]
----

== Generic Functions

Generic Functions have type parameters.
