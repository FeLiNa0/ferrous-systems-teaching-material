= Simple Generics

link:./index.html[Table of Contents]

== !

Generics are fundamental for Rust.

== Generic Structs

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]

== Type Inference

Rust finds the types of all variables and generics with sufficient information.

This only applies *inside* of function bodies.

Signatures must always be fully specified.

== Generic Enums

[source,rust]
----
include::./2.rs[]
----

== Generic Functions

Generic Functions have type parameters.

[source,rust]
----
include::./6.rs[]
----

Generic functions are used when computations can be expressed in an abstract way.
