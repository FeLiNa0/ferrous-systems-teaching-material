= Iterators

link:./index.html[Table of Contents]


== !

Rusts iterators are:

-   Lazy
-   Pervasive
-   Potentially infinite

== Where Do They Come From?

-   Collections like `Vec<T>` have an `iter()` function which yields an iterator.
-   Things like `std::net::TcpListener` which provides an iterator of ``TcpStream``s via ``incoming()``.
-   Functions like `str#split` and `str#split_n`
-   Iterators can be implemented on other structures as well.

== Owned iterators

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]

<1> this won't work

== Borrowed iterators

[source,rust]
----
include::./2.rs[]

== Mutably Borrowed iterators

== Common Uses

== `next()`

Iterators can be manually progressed:

[source,rust]
----
include::./4.rs[]
----

== Combinators: `map()`

Transform items as they are evaluated:

[source,rust]
----
include::./5.rs[]
----

== Combinators: `filter()`

Filter out unwanted values, skipping further computation on them:

include::./6.rs[]
