Rustup is the standard tool for managing Rusts compiler toolchain.

http://rustup.rs/

== Important Commands

[source,sh]
----
include::./1.sh[]
----

== Content of the Toolchain

- rustc
- cargo
- rustdoc

The debugger installed is platform dependent.

== rustc

[source,sh]
----
include::./3.sh[]

The Rust compiler builds and links Rust code.

`rustc` is almost completely written in Rust.

== Functional Test

[source,rust]
----
include::./4.rs[]
----

== !

[source,sh]
----
include::./5b.sh[]
----

== Cargo

[source,sh]
----
include::./6.sh[]

Cargo is Rusts build and package management tool.

Cargo is installed along with `rustc`, but is not tightly bound to a `rustc` version.

== Once more with Cargo

[source,sh]
----
include::./7.sh[]

== A Little Look Around

- What is in Cargo.toml?
- What is in Cargo.lock?
