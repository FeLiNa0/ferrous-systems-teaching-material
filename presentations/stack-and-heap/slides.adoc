== !

Rust defaults to allocation on the stack

== Stack Allocation

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]
----

== Box

Heap allocation is represented by the type `Box`.

[source,rust]
----
include::./2.rs[]
----

== Ownership and Borrowing

`Box` is owned, but you can borrow the contained values.

[source,rust]
----
include::./3.rs[]
----

== Other heap allocations

Other types might allocate on the heap, most notably `Vec` and `String`.

== Placement in

It is currently *not* possible to allocate values at a self-chosen location. The missing feature is called "placement in".

[Detailed discussion here](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/lang-team-minutes-feature-status-report-placement-in-and-box/4646)

== !

In most cases, LLVM already optimizes the stack allocation and the subsequent move to the heap to a direct heap allocation.
