== !

Testing is fundamental to Rust.

Unit, integration, and documentation tests all come builtin.

== Organizing Tests

Tests typically end up in 1 of 4 possible locations:

-   Immediately beside the functionality tested. (Unit test)
-   In a `tests` submodule. (Private integration test)
-   In documentation. (Documentation test)
-   In the `tests/` directory. (Public integration test)

== Unit Tests

-   Allows testing functionality in the same module and environment.
-   Typically exist immediately near the functionality.
-   Good for testing to make sure a single action *works*.

== Unit Tests

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]
----

== Unit Tests

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/testing/2.bash" data-trim="hljs bash"></code></pre>

== `tests` Submodule

-   Allows testing as if the functionality is being used elsewhere in the project.
-   For testing private APIs and functionality.
-   Good for testing expected processes and use cases.

== `tests` Submodule

[source,rust]
----
include::./3.rs[]
----

== `tests` Submodule

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/testing/4.bash" data-trim="hljs bash"></code></pre>

== Documentation Tests

-   Allows testing public functionality.
-   Is displayed in `rustdoc` output.
-   For demonstrating expected use cases and examples.

== Documentation Tests

<pre><code>
/// ```rust
/// use example::Direction;
/// let way_home = Direction::North;
/// ```
pub enum Direction { North, South, East, West }
</code></pre>

== Documentation Tests

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/testing/5.bash" data-trim="hljs bash"></code></pre>

== Integration Tests

-   Tests as if the crate is an external dependency.
-   Intended for longer or full-function tests.

== Integration Tests

`/tests/basic.rs`:

[source,rust]

== Integration Tests
