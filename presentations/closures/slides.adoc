= Closures

link:./index.html[Table of Contents]


== !

Rust has closures. Multiple, even.

* **Advantage:** Highly optimized using only the absolutely necessary runtime resources, often none.
* **Disadvantage:** Knowing the specific closure type is not always easy.

== Closure-Types

FnOnce

* The closure consumes its environment

FnMut

* The closure mutates its environment

Fn

* The closure references its environment immutably

== !

`rustc` infers the type automatically, but it is needed for type signatures!

== !

The relationship between the closure types is: Fn is a supertrait FnMut, FnMut is a supertrait of FnOnce.

== Moves and Closures

As the closure environment is implicit, moving types into the closure is explicit.
