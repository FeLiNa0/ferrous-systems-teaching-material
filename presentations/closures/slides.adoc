== !

Rust has closures. Multiple, even.

* **Advantage:** Highly optimized using only the absolutely necessary runtime resources, often none.
* **Disadvantage:** Knowing the specific closure type is not always easy.

== Closure Types

Moving:: The closure consumes its environment. It can only be called once.

Mutating:: The closure mutates its environment

Referencing:: The closure references its environment immutably

== !

`rustc` infers the type automatically, but it is needed for type signatures!

== Moves and Closures

To resolve ambiguity, closures borrow by default. Moving needs to be requested.
